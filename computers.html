        <h1>Computers</h1>
        <p>I've been really into computers recently. like a LOT... I'm working on a lot of computers at the moment, and the most recent one I got is a Lenovo Ideapad running Windows 7, that I'm going to replace the battery for and get old photos out of.</p>
        <h1>I use arch btw (insert nerd emoji here)</h1>
        <p>I've been using arch on my laptop and desktop for about like 3 months... i think... maybe more, ANYWAYS, I love using it because I get bored really easily, and call me weird but, I like the amount of troubleshooting that comes with Arch. It gives me something to do that I feel productive doing, and it helps me learn more about how an operating system like Arch works. The only plus side I have to give to windows is the convenience for when I don't feel like problem solving, and the much much better support for random problems, and much more software support. When I was modding my xbox 360, i had to use my old laptop that had windows 11 and it made it so much easier. However, the pure amount of popups jumpscared me as I forgot how messy I used to be on computers. (i still am as you can see if you look at this code...) ANYWAYS enough yapping you probably didn't even read this... bye!</p>

              It lowk sucks bc it's a prebuilt from like 2019. and it wasn't good even back then. The only good part about it is the GPU, with a GTX 1650 Ti Super.

        <li>Lenovo Thinkpad T490
          <ul>
            <li>
              I have a Thinkpad T490, and it is really nice, because it has a decent battery, is good with linux, VERY convenient for non-gamers (i barely game anymore) as you don't have to lug around a 20 pound gaming laptop everywhere, and so many other reasons. The creators really outdid themselves making this laptop imo. I love it.

        </li><br />
        <li>Asus Tuf Gaming F17
          <ul>
            <li>
                This is the gaming laptop I have. I lowk don't have the charger for it rn, because it broke, so I can't use it, BUT, it is a beast imo and it can run lots of things especially since the one I have has a decent GPU. The only problem I had with it was that it got REALLY REALLY hot, but then again, I never cleaned it until after I broke the charger (around like 3 years... i know it's disgusting) so that definately reduced temperature performance.
